<p>
    Shortly, you will receive information about your performance relative to AI <strong>2 times</strong>.
    You will either receive a positive message, "Your performance was better than of AI",
    or "Your performance was <strong>not</strong> better than of AI."
</p>

<p>
    These messages will be delivered by 1 of 3 messengers, as shown in the image. However, not all messengers are trustworthy. 
    While 2 messengers always deliver the truth, 1 messenger will always provide false information about your performance. 
    For each message, a messenger will be randomly chosen, and <strong>you will not know which one was chosen</strong>.

<p>
    <strong>This means that each time, there is a 66% probability of receiving a true message and a 33% probability 
    of receiving a false message about your actual performance</strong>. Note that, it is also possible to receive both false messages.
</p>

<p>
    After each message is delivered, you will have another opportunity to estimate the probability that your performance is better than of AI.
    Note, you maximize your payout by giving your best possible estimate.
