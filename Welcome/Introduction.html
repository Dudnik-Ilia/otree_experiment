<p>
    We are a financial company operating in the banking sector. Our goal is to better <strong>understand how individuals make decisions
    compared to artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> in the field of Credit Scoring (Loan Approval task).
</p>

<p>
    During this experiment, you will be asked to perform a series of credit scoring tasks, where you will <strong> assess loan applications </strong>
    and compete with an AI system designed for similar tasks. The <strong>AI model being used is relatively small and straightforward</strong>.
    We would like to understand how well you can perform compared to the AI.
