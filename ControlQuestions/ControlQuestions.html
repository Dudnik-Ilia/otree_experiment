<p> 
    In this experiment, you will provide your estimate for the probability of a specific event occurring. 
    We use the <strong>Randomized Scoring Rule</strong> mechanism.
    The probability you provide will influence your payout: the payout mechanism is designed so that <strong>the more
     truthful</strong> your estimate is, <strong>the more chances</strong> of getting better payout.
</p>

<p>
    Here how it works:
</p> 
<ul> 
    <li>
        You will state the probability <i>Y</i> (e.g., 50%) that you believe France will become the European champion.
    </li> 
    <li>
        The computer randomly selects a number <i>X</i> between 0 and 100.
        <ul> 
            <li>
                If <i>Y</i> &ge; <i>X</i>, you will receive additional payout <em>if France actually becomes champion</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If <i>Y</i> &lt; <i>X</i>, you will win additional payout with a probability of <i>X</i>%, <em>regardless of whether France wins</em>.
            </li>
        </ul> 
    </li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
    <strong>Why is this mechanism used?</strong> This payout method ensures it is always in your best interest to truthfully report your belief.
</p> 

<p><strong>Control Questions:</strong></p>

<p>
    To increase your understanding of the payout mechanism, we now ask you to answer a few control questions.
    However, we will only proceed to the next phase of the experiment once you have answered the questions correctly.
    You have <em>3 tries</em>.
</p>

<p>
    Assume your best estimate that France wins championship is 30%.
</p>

<p>Now, assume additionally that the computer has drawn <i>X</i> equal to 50.</p>
{% formfield player.cntr_quest_2 %}
{% formfield player.cntr_quest_3 %}
