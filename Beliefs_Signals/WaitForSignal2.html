<p>
    A messenger will now deliver the second message about your performance on the IQ test. 
    Once again, the computer has randomly selected one of the three messengers for this task.

    <strong>
        In this experiment, however, you will not know which messenger delivered the message. 
        This means you will never know for certain whether you actually scored in the top 50% 
        of all participants in this session on the IQ test.
