<p>
    We are a financial company operating in the banking sector. Our goal is to better understand how individuals make decisions
    compared to artificial intelligence in the field of Credit Scoring (Loan Approval).
</p>

<p>
    During this experiment, you will be asked to perform a series of credit scoring tasks, where you will assess loan applications
    and compete with an AI system designed for similar tasks. The AI model being used is relatively small and straightforward.
    We would like to understand how well you can perform compared to the AI.
