<p>
    We are a financial company operating in the banking sector.
    Our goal is to better understand how individuals make decisions compared to <b>artificial intelligence (AI)</b> in the field of <b>credit scoring</b> (loan approval tasks).
</p>

<p>
    During this experiment, you will assess loan applications and compete with an AI system designed for similar tasks.
    The AI model used is <b>small and straightforward</b>, meaning it is not a complex financial AI but a <i>basic decision-making model</i> based on clear rules.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Example:</b> The AI might approve or reject loans using if-else rules based on <i>income, credit history,</i> and <i>loan amount</i>.
    Unlike advanced systems, it does not analyze hundreds of factors or hidden patterns.
</p>

<p>We want to see how well you perform compared to the AI.</p>
