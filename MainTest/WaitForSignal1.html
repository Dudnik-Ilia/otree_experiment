<p>A messenger will now deliver the <strong>first message</strong> about your performance relative to AI.</p>
<p>The computer has randomly selected 1 out of 3 messengers for this task.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> in this experiment, however, you will not know which messenger delivered the message. 
    This means you will never know for certain whether you actually outperformed AI or not.
</p>

<p>
    Proceed to see the signal!
