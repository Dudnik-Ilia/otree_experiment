<p>
    A messenger will now deliver the <strong>second message</strong> about your performance relative to AI. 
    The computer has randomly selected one of the three messengers for this task.

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> in this experiment, however, you will not know which messenger delivered the message. 
    This means you will never know for certain whether you actually outperformed AI or not.
