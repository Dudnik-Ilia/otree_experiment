<p>
    Shortly, you will receive information about your performance relative to AI <strong>2 times</strong>.
    You will either receive a positive message, "Your performance was better than of AI",
    or "Your performance was <strong>not</strong> better than of AI."
</p>

<p>
    These messages will be delivered by one of three messengers, as shown in the image below. However, not all messengers are trustworthy. 
    While two messengers always deliver the truth, one messenger will always provide false information about your performance. 
    For each message, the computer will randomly select one of the three messengers, and <strong>you will not know which messenger was chosen</strong>.

<p>
    <strong>This means that each time, there is a 66% probability of receiving a true message and a 33% probability 
    of receiving a false message about your actual performance. Note that, it is also possible to receive two false messages.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    After each message is delivered, you will have another opportunity to estimate the probability that your performance is better than of AI.
    Note, you maximize your payout by giving your best possible estimate.
