    <h2>Motivation for the study</h2>
    <p>
        We as a company are at a critical juncture: the decision to integrate AI systems to replace low-level managers. 
        If we determine that AI significantly outperforms human decision-making, around 
        <strong>1,000 managers</strong> at our branches are <b>going to be replaced</b> by an automated system.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, there is a concern that losing unique human knowledge might disrupt decision-making processes 
        and lead to unforeseen challenges. All this has led to organizing this experiment.
