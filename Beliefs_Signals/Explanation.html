<p>
    The test you just completed was an intelligence test (IQ test).
</p>

<p>
    The computer has evaluated your performance on the IQ test relative to all participants in this session.
</p>

<p>
    Next, we ask you to estimate the probability that you ranked in the top 50% of all participants in this session.
    During the experiment, you will receive <strong>two pieces of information</strong> about your relative performance,
    and you will have the opportunity to update your estimate each time.
</p>

<p>
    For each estimate you provide, you have a chance to win 2 Euros based on the same payout mechanism explained at the
    beginning of the experiment. This means you maximize your payout by giving your best possible estimate.
</p>

<p>
    If two participants achieve the same score, the computer will randomly decide which participant receives the higher and lower rank.
