{{ block content }}

<p>
    Throughout this experiment, you will provide your estimate for the probability of a specific event occurring. 
    The probability you provide will influence your payout. 
    The payout mechanism is designed so that you have the highest chance of receiving an additional payout of 2 Euros 
    if you give your best possible estimate truthfully.
</p> 

<p>
    We will now explain the payout mechanism. 
    As an example, we will use the event "Germany wins the European Football Championship 2021." 
    This example is purely illustrative and will be replaced by a different event in the experiment.
</p> 

<p>
    Please indicate the probability with which you believe that Germany will win the European Football Championship 2021:
</p>  

(Please select a whole number, e.g., 1, 2, 3,..., 99,100)

<p>

</p> 
    
<p>
    After you have provided your estimate, the computer will randomly select a 
    <strong>number X between 0 and 100</strong> in the background. 
    Each number is chosen with equal probability. 
    This would affect your payout as follows:
</p>
  
<ul>
    <p><li>If your stated probability is at least as high as the number X drawn by the computer, 
        then you will receive 2 Euros if Germany actually becomes the European champion.</li></p>
    <p><li>If your stated probability is lower than the number X drawn by the computer, 
        then you will receive 2 Euros with a probability of X%, regardless of whether 
        Germany becomes the European champion in 2021.</li></p>
</ul>
  
<p>
    <strong>This payout mechanism always makes it advantageous to provide your best possible estimate truthfully.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    For example, assume that your true estimate of the probability that Germany will win the European Football Championship 2021 
    is 50%, and you state a probability of 30%. 
    It is possible that the computer will draw the number X equal to 40. 
    In this case, your probability of winning 2 Euros would be 40%. 
    If you had stated 50%, you would win the 2 Euros with a probability of 50% according to your true estimateâ€”specifically 
    if Germany becomes the European champion.
</p> 

<p><strong>Control Questions:</strong></p>

<p>
    To increase your understanding of the payout mechanism, we now ask you to answer a few control questions. 
    We will continue using the example event "Germany wins the European Football Championship 2021." 
    Your answers to these questions will not impact your payouts in the experiment. 
    However, we will only proceed to the next phase of the experiment once all participants have answered the questions correctly.
</p>

<p>
    Assume for the control questions that your best possible estimate of the probability that Germany wins the European Championship in 2021 is 30%.

<p>Now, assume additionally that the computer has drawn the number X equal to 50.</p>
