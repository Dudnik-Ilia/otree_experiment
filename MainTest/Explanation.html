    During the experiment, you will receive <strong>two pieces of information</strong> about your relative performance,
    and you will have the opportunity to update your estimate each time.
</p>

<p>
    Next, we ask you to estimate the <i><em>probability that your performance is above performance of our AI</em></i> in this session.
</p>

<p>
    Remember mechanism explained at the beginning of the experiment. 
    This means you maximize your payout by giving your <strong> best possible estimate </strong>.
