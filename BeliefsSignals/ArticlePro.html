<p>
    Numerous scientific studies have shown that intelligence tests are highly predictive of important life outcomes (Gottfredson, 2003; Neisser et al., 1996; Strenze, 2007).
</p>

<p>
    Longitudinal studies, for instance, show a correlation coefficient of 0.5-0.6 between intelligence and academic performance (Deary & Johnson, 2010; Roth et al., 2015; Strenze, 2007), a coefficient of 0.4-0.5 between intelligence and career success (Gottfredson, 2003; Schmidt & Hunter, 2004; Strenze, 2007), and a correlation of up to 0.4 between intelligence and income (Gottfredson, 2003; Strenze, 2007).
</p>

<p>
    These results are confirmed by a recent long-term study from Denmark (Hegelund et al., 2018), which found that IQ test results are also associated with important indicators in education and labor market research. For example, the likelihood of unemployment significantly decreases with higher IQ.
</p>

<p>
    Figure 1, taken from the Hegelund et al. (2018) study, illustrates the strong relationship between IQ test results and income based on a large dataset.

    The predictive power of general intelligence extends even further. For example, Gottfredson and Deary (2004) found that intelligent people tend to be healthier and have a longer life expectancy. Additionally, DeVader and Alliger (1986) showed that intelligent people possess a greater potential for leadership.
