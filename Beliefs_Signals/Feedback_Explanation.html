<p>
    Shortly, you will receive information about your performance on the IQ test twice. You will either receive a positive message, 
    "Your performance was in the top 50%," or a negative message, "Your performance was <strong>not</strong> in the top 50%."
</p>

<p>
    These messages will be delivered by one of three messengers, as shown in the image below. However, not all messengers are trustworthy. 
    While two messengers always deliver the truth, one messenger will always provide false information about your performance on the IQ test. 
    For each message, the computer will randomly select one of the three messengers, and you will not know which messenger was chosen.

    <strong>This means that each time, there is a two-thirds probability of receiving a true message and a one-third probability 
    of receiving a false message about your actual performance. However, it is also possible to receive two false messages.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    After each message is delivered, you will have another opportunity to estimate the probability that you ranked in the top 50% 
    of all participants. Each time you make an estimate, you have a chance to win 2 Euros based on the same payout mechanism explained 
    at the beginning of the experiment. This means you maximize your payout by giving your best possible estimate.
