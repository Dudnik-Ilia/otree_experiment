<p>
    In the first part of the experiment, we ask you to complete a quiz with 15 questions. 
    You will see a pattern with a missing section, and your task is to choose the correct piece 
    from four options and then press the "Next" button.
</p>

<p>
    You have 30 seconds for each pattern to select the correct answer and click the "Next" button. 
    For each correct answer in the quiz, you will earn a point. Each point is associated with 
    an additional payout. The payout per point is randomly determined by the computer for each 
    question and varies between 10 cents and 50 cents per point.
</p>

<p>
    On the next page, you will have the opportunity to answer a sample question to familiarize 
    yourself with the quiz format!
