<p>
    In the end of the next 2 rounds of Credit Assessment tasks, you will receive <strong>Messages about your relative performance</strong> that will be delivered to you.
    Right after them you will have the opportunity to update your estimate (<b>make a new guess</b>) of your performance each time.
</p>

<p>
    These messages will be delivered by 1 of 3 messengers, as shown in the image. However, not all messengers are trustworthy. 
    While 2 messengers always deliver the truth, 1 messenger will always provide false information about your performance. 
    For each message, a messenger will be randomly chosen, and <strong>you will not know which one was chosen</strong>.

<p>
    <strong>This means that each time, there is a 66% probability of receiving a true message and a 33% probability 
    of receiving a false message about your actual performance</strong>. Note that, it is also possible to receive both false messages.
</p>

<p>
    After each message, you will have another chance to estimate how likely it is that you performed better than the AI.
    <b>Note:</b> You maximize your payout by providing your most accurate estimate.
