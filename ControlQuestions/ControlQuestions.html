{{ block content }}

<p>In this experiment, you will provide your estimate for the probability of a specific event occurring. We use the <b>Randomized Scoring Rule</b> mechanism.</p>

<p><b>What does this mean?</b> Your estimate affects your payout: the more accurate your probability estimate, the better your expected payout.</p>

<h3>How it Works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You state the probability <b>Y</b> (e.g., <i>50%</i>) that you believe France will become the European champion.</li>
  <li>The computer randomly selects a number <b>X</b> between <i>0 and 100</i>.</li>
  <li>If <b>Y ≥ X</b>, you get a bonus payout <b>if France actually wins</b>.</li>
  <li>If <b>Y < X</b>, you win a bonus payout with a probability of <b>X%</b>, regardless of whether France wins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why is this Mechanism Used?</h3>
<p>This method ensures that <b>being truthful maximizes your chances of receiving better payout.</b></p>

<p><b>Example:</b>Suppose you believe France has a <b>60%</b> chance of winning.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You report <b>Y = 60%</b>.</li>
  <li>The computer randomly picks <b>X = 40</b> (between 0 and 100).</li>
  <li>Since <b>60 ≥ 40</b>, you will get a bonus <b>if France wins.</b></li>
  <li>If you had reported an artificially higher probability (e.g., <b>Y = 90%</b>), you would not gain any advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example:</b> If you <b>understate</b> your probability (e.g., say 30% when you really think it's 60%), you might win less because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If <b>X = 50</b>, but France actually wins, you <b>won't receive the bonus</b> because <b>30 < 50</b>.</li>
  <li>However, if you had reported your true belief (60%), you <b>would have won the bonus</b> since <b>60 ≥ 50</b> and France won.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way, the system encourages you to report your real belief rather than guessing.</p>


<h2>Control Questions:</h2>

<p>
    To increase your understanding of this mechanism, we now ask you to answer a couple control questions.
    However, we will only proceed to the next phase of the experiment once you have answered the questions correctly.
    You have <em>3 tries</em>.
</p>

<p>
    Assume your best estimate that France wins championship is <b>30%</b>.
